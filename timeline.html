            for the first official team meeting of R3P2 of the 2019-2020 season.
            With a team of over 60 members, we have once again broken our team size
            record. Training, practice and experimentation are all tasks that our
            subteams will be undertaking over the next few months before kickoff on

            From April 10th to 13th, R3P2 had the privelage of competing at the Ontario
            District Championships alongside some of the best teams in the world.
            We worked hard to qualify throughout the season and were proud to seed
            16th out of the 40 teams in the Science division. We also won the championship
            entrepreneurship award, an amazing feat. Our team finished the competition
            ranking 57 in the district out of a total of 179 teams! Sadly, this was
            not enough to qualify for the World Championships in Detroit and as such,
            this brings an end to the 2019 season for R3P2. We'd like to thank all
