          <h2> Ontario District Championships </h2>
          <p>
            From April 10th to 13th, R3P2 had the privelage of competiting at the Ontario
            District Championships alongside some of the best teams in the world.
            We worked hard to qualify throughout the season and were proud to seed
            16th out of the 40 teams in the Science division. We also won the championship
            entrepreneurship award, an amazing feat. Our team finished the competition
            ranking 57 in the district out of a total of 179 teams! Sadly, this was
            not enough to qualify for the World Championships in Detroit and as such,
            this brings an end to the 2019 season for R3P2. We'd like to thank all
            our sponsors and we hope to see everyone back for next year's season.

            us to join the fifth alliance alongisde 5596 to face the fourth alliance in playoffs.
            After a hard fought quarterfinals with a scoring tie and a tiebreaker match,
            we were sadly eliminated. However with our impressive run at this event,
            we racked up enough points to qualify for the Ontario District Championships

            To increase awarness of FIRST and STEM at Riverdale, the Riverdale Raiders
            Robotics ran a new initiative: the Robotics Fair! This event allows all
            students to get a chance to get an inside peek into R3P2 and learn about
            all of our moving parts from Computer Aided Design to Sponsorship Relations.
            The students also get a chance to get to drive the robot and complete an
            obstacle course. The event was a huge success and we have already seen huge
            increases in interest during our recruitment.

            during the entire competition. Sadly, our power up season ends here

            In the summer of 2017, 3 disastrous hurricanes hit southern North
            America, 2 of which immensely affected many islands in the Caribbean.
            Most of these countries almost completely destroyed and students and
            children were not able to attend school until much later in the year.
            Our fundraiser, Care for the Caribbean intends to raise money for
            this cause and in turn provide students with school supplies, and
            other technology assests to help them succeed and learn.
