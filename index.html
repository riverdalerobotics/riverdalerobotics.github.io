          <h2> Ontario District Championships </h2>
          <p>
            From April 10th to 13th, R3P2 had the privelage of competiting at the Ontario
            District Championships alongside some of the best teams in the world.
            We worked hard to qualify throughout the season and were proud to seed
            16th out of the 40 teams in the Science division. We also won the championship
            entrepreneurship award, an amazing feat. Our team finished the competition
            ranking 57 in the district out of a total of 179 teams! Sadly, this was
            not enough to qualify for the World Championships in Detroit and as such,
            this brings an end to the 2019 season for R3P2. We'd like to thank all
            our sponsors and we hope to see everyone back for next year's season.

          <p>
            On April 5th, R3P2 packed it's bags and travelled to London, Ontario
            to compete in the Western Engineering Distrct Event at Western University.
            The weekend treated us well and at the end of the qualification rounds,
            5834 seeded at 11th out of 40 teams! In alliance selection, 5408 graciously invited
            us to join the fifth alliance alongisde 5596 to face the fourth alliance in playoffs.
            After a hard fought quarterfinals with a scoring tie and a tiebreaker match,
            we were sadly eliminated. However with our impressive run at this event,
            we racked up enough points to qualify for the Ontario District Championships
            taking place next weekend. We can't wait to see you all there!
